**1. Data Extraction & Transformation Using Power Query Editor**

Successfully imported and transformed large datasets from various sources (e.g., distributors, online, retail) utilizing Power Query Editor to clean and preprocess data, ensuring high data integrity and consistency for accurate analysis.

Leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures, enhancing report insights and enabling deeper analysis of revenue and order trends across different time periods and sales channels.

**2. Interactive Reporting & Key Performance Metrics**

Designed and developed an interactive Power BI report showcasing critical metrics such as Total Orders (53K), Total Revenue (17.91M), and Total Quantity (6M), providing actionable insights into the businessâ€™s performance.

Created dynamic filters and visualizations to break down revenue by Year and Sales Channel (Distributor, Online, Retail), enabling stakeholders to track and analyze sales performance from multiple perspectives.

**3. In-Depth Revenue Analysis & Product Category Insights**

Conducted a detailed revenue breakdown, highlighting that Food revenue (91.12%) outweighs Drink revenue with a total of $16.37M, offering key insights into product category performance.

Developed performance analysis reports segmented by Supervisor, Manager, and Salesperson, allowing for efficient performance tracking and targeted business strategy adjustments.

**Note that there are two datasets: one is the Orders table, and the other is the Products table, where the Product ID serves as the primary key. In the model view section of Power BI, I have created a one-to-many relationship between these two tables.**
